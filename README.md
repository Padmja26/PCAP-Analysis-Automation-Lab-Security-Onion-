# PCAP Analysis Lab with Security Onion

## Overview
The **PCAP Analysis Automation Lab** is designed to streamline the process of importing, analyzing, and reporting on network traffic captures (PCAPs) using **Security Onion**. The objective of this project is to leverage **Security Onion’s** powerful suite of tools to detect and investigate potential malware activity, generate comprehensive reports, and visualize findings on interactive dashboards.

By utilizing **Security Onion**, we can:
- Import **malware traffic PCAPs** into the system
- Analyze network behavior and detect anomalies using built-in IDS/IPS tools
- Generate security reports based on findings
- Build dashboards to visualize network threats

This repository contains documentation for setting up and using the lab, including step-by-step configuration guides.

## Requirements
To set up the **PCAP Analysis Automation Lab**, ensure you have the following components:

### 1. Virtualization Platform
- **VirtualBox** or **VMware** (Virtual Machine Software)
- **At least 8GB RAM** allocated for Security Onion VM (Recommended: 16GB+ for optimal performance)
- **Minimum 2 CPU Cores** (Recommended: 4 Cores)

### 2. Security Onion
- Download the latest **Security Onion ISO** from [Security Onion’s official website](https://securityonion.net/)
- Install it in a **Virtual Machine (VM)** with network settings configured correctly (Bridged/Host-Only)

### 3. PCAP Files for Analysis
- Collection of **malware traffic capture files** (PCAPs) for testing
- Sources for malware PCAPs:
  - [Malware Traffic Analysis](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/)
  - [Wireshark Sample Captures](https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures)

### 4. Additional Tools (Optional)
- **Wireshark** (for manual packet analysis)
- **Kibana, Elasticsearch** (Security Onion includes these for dashboarding)
- **Python** (for scripting automated analysis workflows, if needed)

## Configuration & Setup
The detailed configuration steps will be documented in **`configuration.md`**.

This will include:
- Installing **Security Onion** on VirtualBox
- Importing **PCAP files** into Security Onion for analysis
- Using **tools like Zeek, Suricata, and Kibana** to investigate threats
- Automating **report generation and dashboard setup**
